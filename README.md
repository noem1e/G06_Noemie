# e.	Methods
We did several power analysis to idenitfy the correct number of participants needed for a replication. After acquiring the raw data, we cleansed it off of low quality data and ended up with 833 participants. For the statistical analysis we used the statictical programm R and for the correlations we used the standard Welch T-Test. All plots and graphs were also made with R.

For my own hypothesis I calculated the correlation and tested for significance using the Pearson's product moment Correlation. 
"Hypothese: Ein höheres Mass an Testosteron ist mit einer besseren Leistung im Kurzzeitgedächtnis verbunden."

# f.	Results
We found a significant difference in testosterone levels between males and females, with the mean in the male group being 23.2 and in the female group 1.22. Additionally, we found a correlation between the performance difference in SD and LD, which is in line with our hypothesis. WIth the data on the amygdala as well as on the hippocampus, we were able to identify a close correlation (0.74) between these two brain regions. This is to be expected, as they are both responsible for processing emotional memories.

For my own hypothesis I found a significant slightly negative correlation (-0.15) between testosterone and short term memory. The repdata showed a similar pattern.

Feedback: ca. 2 stunden. gab viele probleme, sachen funktionieren manchmal nicht und es war schwierig so viele fenster handzuhaben. ich fand es schwierig, zu unterscheiden wann man online, desktop oder computer machen mussste. Es ging aber, ich denke man braucht einfach Übung, um den dreh raus zu haben.
